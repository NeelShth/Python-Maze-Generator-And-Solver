A Maze Generator and Solver using Pygame.

Features:
- Randomly or Manually set start and end nodes

- Animated Generation of Mazes
- Generation Algorithms:
   - Recursive Backtracker
   - Prim's Algorithm
   - Kruskal's Algorithm
   - Binary Tree

- Animated Solving of Mazes
- Solving Algorithms:
   - Breadth First Search
   - Depth First Search
   - Djstrika's Shortest Path Algorithm
   - A* Algorithm

Notes:
- Animation freezes above Maze Size 14X14, however generation and solving will continue without animation
- Test function included
